## Instructions

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I'd converted this project from a static project to an interactive one mostly with the JavaScript file based on the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the result of my work on the project.
